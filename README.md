## Installation

4. Click Install
5. Enable the plugin

Or manually:
1. Download `main.js`, `manifest.json`, and `styles.css` from the [latest release](https://github.com/AlexXYK/flare-ai/releases/latest)
2. Create a `flare-ai` folder in your vault's `.obsidian/plugins/` directory
3. Copy the downloaded files into the folder
4. Enable the plugin in Obsidian settings

## Quick Start

1. Open Settings > FLARE.ai
2. Add at least one provider:
   - For Ollama: Use default endpoint `http://localhost:11434` or a remote endpoint
   - For OpenAI: Add your API key
   - For OpenRouter: Add your API key
3. Create your first Flare via the "Create Flare" button in the settings
4. Start chatting!

> If you encounter any issues during initial setup (i.e. models not appearing in the title generation dropdown or the reasoning model toggle not appearing when selecting an Ollama provider in the Flare congig menu), simply navigate out of the settings tab and back in.

## Using Flares

Flares are markdown files that define AI personas. They live in your vault and can be edited directly.

Example Flare:
```markdown
---
name: CodeAssistant
description: Programming and technical help
provider: ollama-default
model: llama3.1
temperature: 0.7
maxTokens: 2048
contextWindow: 3  # Number of conversation pairs to maintain during chat
handoffContext: 1  # Number of pairs to carry over when switching flares
stream: true
enabled: true
isReasoningModel: false

You are an expert programmer focused on clear explanations and practical examples.
- Provide code snippets when relevant
- Explain complex concepts simply
- Suggest best practices
